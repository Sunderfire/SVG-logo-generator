# SVG-logo-generator

## Description

In this challenge, I have made a SVG logo generator.  Writing it has challenged my understanding of Test-Driven Development and my ability to adapt to writing a new type of file: .svg.  I learned about organizing my classes into different .js files and calling those files into my main index.js to bring the whole app together.

## Usage

Run the application from the command line using node index.js.  You will be prompted with a series of questions asking you details about the logo's text and shape.  Once you have entered each answer, the generator will create a new logo.svg that will display your logo generated according to your specifications.
